n this tutorial we will be making a Simple Calculator using JavaScript. There will be some elements of HTML and CSS with this tutorial but the main focus is using and getting used to JavaScript Syntaxes. JavaScript is very similar to C# Syntaxes we have used so far but there are some subtle differences with both of them and they both do very different things in the world of software engineering. JavaScript is the most popular programming language and it has been on top of the charts for a very long time. I have been planning to do a lot of JavaScript tutorials for this website for a while and I want to explore the games development element of JavaScript. I found that it was very easy to move over to JavaScript however it is important to know that you will need to have a brief understanding of HTML and CSS. JavaScript doesnâ€™t handle the Images and page elements on its own therefore we need to learn a little bit of HTML and CSS to get us up to speed on this. This is the first of a series of tutorials I will be publishing on the website around JavaScript projects and Games Development. Hope you enjoy this one. Lets get started.
