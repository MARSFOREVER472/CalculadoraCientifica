- _In this tutorial we will be making a Simple Calculator using JavaScript._
- _There will be some elements of HTML and CSS with this tutorial but the main focus is using and getting used to JavaScript Syntaxes._
- _JavaScript is very similar to C# Syntaxes we have used so far but there are some subtle differences with both of them and they both do very different things in the world of software engineering._
- _JavaScript is the most popular programming language and it has been on top of the charts for a very long time._
- _I have been planning to do a lot of JavaScript tutorials for this website for a while and I want to explore the games development element of JavaScript._
- _I found that it was very easy to move over to JavaScript however it is important to know that you will need to have a brief understanding of HTML and CSS._
- _JavaScript doesnâ€™t handle the Images and page elements on its own therefore we need to learn a little bit of HTML and CSS to get us up to speed on this._
- _This is the first of a series of tutorials I will be publishing on the website around JavaScript projects and Games Development._
- _Hope you enjoy this one._

Lets get started.
